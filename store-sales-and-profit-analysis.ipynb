It helps businesses identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize their operations, pricing, marketing, and inventory management strategies to drive revenue and growth. \n\n- To perform a store sales and profit analysis, you'll need access to relevant sales and financial data. This data should include information on product sales, pricing, costs, and expenses. Here's a general outline of the steps involved in conducting a sales and profit analysis:\n\n1. Gather data: Collect sales data for the period you want to analyze. This could include daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly sales figures. Additionally, gather information on costs associated with running the store, such as inventory costs, employee wages, rent, utilities, and marketing expenses.\n\n2. Calculate revenue: Determine the total revenue generated during the analyzed period. This can be calculated by summing up the sales figures for each product or service.\n\n3. Calculate cost of goods sold (COGS): Calculate the cost of goods sold, which includes the direct costs associated with producing or acquiring the products sold. This typically includes the cost of materials, labor, and overhead expenses directly attributed to production.\n\n4. Calculate gross profit: Subtract the COGS from the revenue to obtain the gross profit. Gross profit represents the amount of money left after deducting the direct costs of producing or acquiring goods from the revenue.\n\n   Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold\n\n5. Analyze gross profit margin: Calculate the gross profit margin, which is the percentage of gross profit relative to revenue. It indicates the profitability of the products being sold.\n\n   Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) x 100\n\n6. Analyze expenses: Review the various expenses incurred by the store, such as rent, utilities, wages, marketing, and other operating costs. Categorize and analyze these expenses to understand their impact on overall profitability.\n\n7. Calculate net profit: Deduct all expenses from the gross profit to calculate the net profit. Net profit represents the final amount of profit earned after considering all costs and expenses.\n\n   Net Profit = Gross Profit - Expenses\n\n8. Analyze profitability ratios: Calculate key profitability ratios to assess the overall financial health of the store. Some common ratios include the net profit margin (net profit divided by revenue), return on investment (net profit divided by total assets), and return on equity (net profit divided by shareholders' equity).\n\n9. Identify trends and patterns: Analyze the data over different time periods and look for trends, patterns, and correlations. Identify the factors that contribute to fluctuations in sales and profitability, such as seasonal variations, marketing campaigns, pricing changes, or external factors like economic conditions.\n\n10. Make strategic decisions: Based on the analysis, identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions to enhance sales and profitability. This could involve optimizing product mix, adjusting pricing strategies, reducing costs, improving operational efficiency, or investing in marketing initiatives.\n\n- Remember, the specific analysis will vary depending on the nature of your store and the available data. It can be helpful to use spreadsheets or specialized accounting software to organize and analyze the data effectively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to Make a Profit in Retail\n\n- The world of retail has changed dramatically with the advent of online shopping and big-box stores. But the basics of retail success still rest on the ability to understand what customers want and need, and to offer it at a reasonable price. Retail profit is the difference between the revenue that a retailer earns through direct sales, and the expenses he incurs keeping his storefront stocked and his business running. Retailers can increase profit by working with either side of the profit equation, either increasing sales or cutting expenses.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Attracting the Right Customers\n\n- Retail success depends on attracting the right customers, those who are interested in your particular offerings and are willing to pay for them. Although advertising can be useful for raising awareness about your store and your brand, it can be expensive, cutting into your profit. Find cost-effective ways to appeal to the customers most likely to support your store. Use your website to showcase your retail location, providing pictures and information. Create unique window displays and reward customers who refer their friends with perks such as a free service or a percentage off their next purchase. A central retail location can also help draw your target market by increasing access to your store.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Meeting Demand\n\n- A successful retailer keeps sufficient product on hand. If a customer can't find what he wants on your shelves, he's likely to look for it elsewhere and may not return to make future purchases. Keeping your shelves well-stocked involves understanding customer purchasing patterns as well as supplier schedules: If it takes weeks to restock a popular item, then you must be proactive and order it long before you run out. Keep records of sales and orders, and refer to them when creating your purchasing strategy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Managing Inventory\n\n- Although it is critical for a retailer to have sufficient stock, profitability also depends on strategically limiting inventory levels. The more money you have tied up in product that sits on your shelf unsold, the less money you have available for essential daily expenses such as rent and payroll. Cash-flow shortfalls may force you to borrow money and incur finance charges, further cutting into your profit. Maintaining reasonably low inventory levels can also contribute to profitability by averting waste, especially if your products are perishable. This decreased waste will show up in your profit and loss equation as lower expenses, or higher profit.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Savvy Cost Cutting\n\n- Retail businesses encounter daily opportunities to cut costs and save money. Staffing should be lean but sufficient, with enough hours slated to take care of customers and keep shelves attractively stocked. However, if employees are standing around, you may be overstaffed. Audit all of your expenditures, from your electricity bill to your shelving. Cut costs where you can, while avoiding cutting things such as essential inventory purchases that directly help you earn money.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport plotly.colors as colors\npio.templates.default = \"plotly_white\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T09:58:40.813468Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T09:58:40.81421Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.674074Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T09:58:40.814173Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.672704Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/superstore-dataset-final/Sample - Superstore.csv\", encoding='latin-1')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.677374Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.677894Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.833485Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.677841Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.83074Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.835588Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.836067Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.875877Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.836024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.874567Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# looking at the descriptive statistics of the dataset:\nprint(data.describe())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.879626Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.880385Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.922136Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.880307Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-18T09:58:43.918414Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Check Columns\n\n- The dataset has an order date column.
